        <p>Alex and Jordan were excited about their trip to the city. They had saved up their money and planned a shopping spree with their father. As they entered the first store, Alex noticed the prices of items were written like $18.400,$203.50 etc. He asked his father what these values are.

    Alex and Jordan enjoyed their day to the fullest and happily went back home. They learned about the use of decimals in pricing, recognizing how numbers like $18.400 and $203.50 represent dollars and cents respectively. They practised more and more on comparing these values, understanding how decimals help specify and compare prices accurately, aided by a useful place value chart.</p>
